# Monotonic Early Exiting

## Setting up

- Create python virtual environment with `venv` or with `conda`
- Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## The experiments

We ran several experiments, described below.

### Monotonicity Experiments
Scripts to run the monotonicity experiment are located in `src/check_monotonicity_scripts/*`.

### Hidden state similarity and identifying the sequence types
The notebook with the sequence type experiment is located in `src/sequence_types_sum.ipynb`.

### New confidence measures
The scripts for testing the new confidence measures are located in `src/scripts/*`.
